Value Driven Graphics Prototype

## Known Quirks and Issues

Please read before running:
* Localhost necessary.
* Optimized for Desktop Safari but should run okay on different platforms with the exception being the font size of some dynamic text elements.
* Clicks are not always successfully distinguished from other gestures, which can result in accidental clicks registering on `mouseup` when trying to drag, pinch or scroll clickable elements.
* To pinch, press and hold the `option` key, then move the cursor slightly before starting to drag.
* The majority of the onscreen keyboard is sometimes underneath invisible layers. If unresponsive, please click on the bottom section of the screen.
* For more guidance but less of a polished look, enable hints for interactive elements by changing line No. 4 of `app.coffee` to `Framer.Extras.Hints.enable()` and recompile.
